				<h3>Naomi Gradinaru</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/naomi.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Science Olympiad is a big priority for me, and I'm willing to go the extra mile to ensure that we succeed next year. As an officer, I will support the creation of a build squad comprised of about 5 students that focus their efforts towards build events, and I will work towards finding adult mentors for study events. I will also make the commons more available as a space to work on builds and as a space to have team bonding activities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-andrew">
				<h3>Andrew Xue</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/andrew.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>I believe in making things easy for our members. I will make sure competition dates, schedules, and requirements are posted early. I will abolish last-minute switching of events without consent. I will always be at meetings to answer questions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-patrick">
				<h3>Patrick Liu</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/patrick.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>I wouldn't fix what ain't broken, so I would keep event sets, tryouts, and other A team-related business with minimal changes. However, I would try a completely different strategy for the elements that didn't work so well this year&mdash;particularly the management of newcomers and builds. Here's to experimentation!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-lukas">
				<h3>Lukas Corey</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/lukas.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>If elected, I plan to make this club a community. In order to minimize previous issues with changes in event sets and people leaving, I'll treat people (especially freshmen!) with a friendly attitude, and I'll work to develop better organization of events to be able to compensate for people leaving without complete switching of events. I will work to get forms out earlier and bug people so that we don't have to rush them in at the last minute and I look forward to working with such an awesome group of people.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-erich">
				<h3>Erich Liang</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/erich.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Do you want an experienced, dedicated, and fabulous officer? Do you want someone who can help double your performance, triple your fun, and half your studying time? Then vote Erich Liang for Science Olympiad officer!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-daniel">
				<h3>Daniel Hou</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/daniel.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Making Nationals is critical next year. I can deliver that with my proven track record of high commitment and my expertise in planning, organizing, coordinating, and leading our teams. The ideas I ran on last year were incredibly successful this year&mdash;the number of medaling A Team members exploded from just 2 to all 15&mdash;and I want to continue that trend next year. Do you?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-niki">
				<h3>Niki Petrakos</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/niki.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>I don't know about you, but I think it's about time we BEAT BOTHELL and GO TO NATIONALS! By adding three essential factors to the club that are missing: spirit, cohesiveness, and organization. Sure, planning for the next year is important, but leaving a legacy for others to follow is just as necessary&mdash;once we all graduate, what happens next? We don't want to see all of our hard work just fade away, right? As your officer, I promise to add these three elements and work through the "red tape" to make sure our goals are met!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-gayatri">
				<h3>Gayatri Shandar</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/gayatri.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>As a club, we are often at odds with the other teams that run Science Olympiad as a class&mdash;which means we need to organize and structure ourselves as much as possible. As an officer next year, I can not only organize our team, but organize fundraising, logistics, and accounting. By voting for me, you can expect to receive more help studying, a more consistent event set, and a more tight-knit team (equipped with lots more swag with the more money we raise!).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-yael">
				<h3>Yael Goldin</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/yael.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>I want to be an officer because I want to be an option for club members to come to if they need help on studying or especially building projects, as I have learned the rules and best methods of approaching each build event. I believe I am qualified to lead Science Olympiad because of the dedication I've shown this year in hosting multiple build meetings and because of the management experience I had in being the C team build officer. I want to make event organization easier for the members so they do not have to worry about being assigned a new event the week before the competition.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-anna">
				<h3>Anna Lee</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/anna.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>At state, I've learned that trying to finish Air Trajectory in 5 hours the night before is not the best idea. If it took so much effort to finish one event, then being an officer and preparing what's needed for the club will take a whole mountain-load of work. But I'm willing to give that to Sci Oly and more, if it means we'll up our chances at beating Bothell next year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-kevin">
				<h3>Kevin Qiu</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/kevin.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Hello everybody, this is Kevin Qiu, aka acuskev or #1 bug ;) After two years as a participant, I'm running for Scioly officer so everybody in every team can have a more interesting experience, namely by clearing up logistical clutter and working to bring new faces into the club - this way we not only have more time to improve on events but also have fun with more people while doing it. 
				<p>I have two years of experience as Senior Patrol Leader of a Boy Scout troop, including organization of fundraisers, campouts, and ecology conservation projects, and I hope to apply this experience to the organization of Scioly's activities.</p>
				<p>I promise to build off previous officers' successes and address issues of club member apathy, competition event hassles, and other issues which get in the way of everybody's experience, and I hope for your vote so that we can all work together to make next year a wonderful success for Scioly!</p>

				<h3>Suvansh Sanjeev</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/suvansh.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Hi guys! Unfortunately, I will not be here for elections, as I am competing in another science competition this weekend. I want to be your officer because I know that Interlake Science Olympiad has the tools it needs to continue to improve its performance as it has continuously done since its inception. With more efficient assignment of events and greater accountability of members to each other, we stand a far greater chance of making the push we need to make nationals next year, and I intend to implement these improvements.</p>

				<h3>Siyao Ding</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/siyao.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Hi, it's Siyao! If elected, I plan to make Interlake Science Olympiad's 2015-2016 season a great run by developing a positive culture in our club, reintroducing structural integrity to our organizational systems, and creating a space where members feel compelled to study and build to their greatest potential. I would really appreciate your vote and confidence, and I hope we can maintain our reputation as the "team with the most heart!"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-linda">
				<h3>Linda Gong</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/linda.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>Voting for me means voting for all the potential sponsors that I can bring (and have already brought to) this club&mdash;Microsoft, Peaks, Starbucks (wouldn't it be cool if Starbucks sponsored our teams), etc. It also means voting for someone who owns speakers and can turn every meeting into a dance party (i.e. someone with this club's best interests at mind). Make a good lin-vestment by voting for Linda!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container" id="candidates-rolanda">
				<h3>Rolanda Fu</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/rolanda.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>What is critical to our success next year and beyond is getting better results for our events, retaining newcomers, and improving the club organization. Something I am willing to do is work with teachers to have numerous workshops throughout the year so members will have much more hands-on experience before the competitions; group interactions such as these will build stronger teams and also encourage confidence and lasting interest in our newcomers, creating a stronger club overall. I have already dedicated countless hours towards Science Olympiad, and with my experience in decision-making with peers and staff, I hope to help the club become more successful than ever before.</p>

			<div class="container" id="candidates-raymond">
				<h3>Raymond Hsu</h3>
				<img src="images/candidates/raymond.png" id="candidate-photos" align="left">
				<p>This was my first year on Interlake Science Olympiad and I plan on making newcomers' experiences just as amazing as mine. On top of food and fun activities which everyone enjoys, I plan on increasing C team commitment by mandating a collaborative study guide between all members doing that certain event. Of course A team members will do the most work followed by B and C, but the idea is to remind C team that they are worth something (because they are, they are the future of our club!) and that they have commitment to this club. Furthermore, now that I am on ASB, I can ensure better relations between the administration and science olympiad in aspects such as fundraising (which I intend to do a lot of), the pesky "sign this sheet if you want to eat food" policy, and moost importantly, funding.</p>
